# scripts

Forked from [Gilles Castel's Setup](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-3/). Collection of scripts allowing for easy management of course files and automatic snippet loading based on course schedule. My changes include
- homework management setup
- making the scripts actually work after a few years of python updates
- some changes to how the output of countdown.py is styled so that it would look nice with a software I don't use anymore
